# _TAPROOM REDUX_

#### _React Week 3 Independent Project_

#### By _**KEVIN DAVIS**_

## Description

_A tap room application to explore basic structures and functionality in React, now amended to include state management with Redux._

## User Stories

* As a user, I want to see a list/menu of all available kegs. For each keg, I want to see its name, brand, price and alcoholContent (or perhaps something like flavor for a kombucha store).
* As a user, I want to submit a form to add a new keg to a list.
* As a user, I want to be able to click on a keg to see its detail page.
* As a user, I want to see how many pints are left in a keg.
* As a user, I want to be able to click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1. Pints should not be able to go below 0.
